wrap the content inside the files _posts/post*.md with the standard liquid header (like other files inside _posts, following the jekyll blog format).

and after the liquid header add the following lines (including "---" and bounded by "---"):

---
*XXXX*

![YYYY](/assets/images/zzz.png)

*By Peter Teoh, Science Writer*
---

wheere XXXX is the appropriate title for the post, and YYYY is a description for a image to be generated relevant to the post, and zzz is the image name.

and rename the filename (ie, instead of post1.md, it should be YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md) likewise also.    you can used today date.   and you can read the content of the files as well.
