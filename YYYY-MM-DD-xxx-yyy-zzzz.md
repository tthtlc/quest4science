## Exploring the strange world of quadratic irrationals

*By Peter Teoh, Science Writer*

Quadratic irrationals are irrational numbers that are roots of quadratic equations with integer coefficients. They often appear in number theory, continued fractions, and Diophantine approximation. Below are several **example problems** involving quadratic irrationals, ranging from basic to more advanced.

### **Example 1: Identify a Quadratic Irrational**
**Problem:**
XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXX

---

### Summary of Key Ideas:
- They come in **conjugate pairs**.
- They are central to solving **Pell's equation** x² − Dy² = 1.

---

### Side Notes

- Quadratic irrationals are **dense** on the real line — between any two rational numbers, you can find infinitely many of them!
