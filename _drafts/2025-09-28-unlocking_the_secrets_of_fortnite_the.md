Hey there, tech-savvy teens! Today, we're diving deep into the world of Fortnite, a game that has taken the globe by storm. But have you ever paused to think what goes on behind those high-energy battles and fort-building shenanigans? Let's unlock those secrets!

## 1. The Physics of Fortnite
Fortnite isn't just about picking up the best guns and building forts. It's also incorporating real-world physics. When you launch a rocket or throw a grenade, the trajectory it follows is based on real physics equations, including *gravity* and *air resistance*.

## 2. Rendering 3D Graphics

Behind those vivid graphics and smooth animations, there's a whole world of complex programming and mathematics. Fortnite uses a game engine called Unreal Engine 4 which uses a technique called *ray tracing*. It's a way to simulate how light sources influence the scene and its objects.

```python
# A simplified function that demonstrates ray tracing
def ray_tracing(light_source, scene_objects):
    """
    Determines how a light source influences a particular scene.
    """
    for object in scene_objects:
        if is_light_visible(object, light_source):
            object.color = calculate_lighting(object, light_source)
```

## 3. Networking and Servers

Ever wondered how you get to play with players from all over the world in real time? This is made possible by a system of *servers* and *networking protocols*. When you move or shoot in the game, that data is sent to a server, then relayed to other players, all in microseconds.

## 4. Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Fortnite makes use of AI for those non-player characters. This AI, based on patterns and algorithms, determines how these characters react to player actions.

Get this: the exciting world of Fortnite is a mashup of physics, computer graphics, networking, and AI! Now, isn't that an epic game of science?
