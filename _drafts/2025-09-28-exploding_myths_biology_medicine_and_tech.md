Ever wondered why adults often seem perplexed by your ability to catch up with the newest tech trends or that you can stay up until 2 AM and still rock your school assignments the next day? The answer lies in your biology and your innate, and often unappreciated, superpowers. 

So let's dive into the truth behind these three worlds: Biology, Medicine, and Technology, and debunk some myths along the way.

### Biology

**Myth**: Teens need as much sleep as adults.

**Fact**: As a teenager, your body is growing at a rapid speed, which requires more sleep. The National Sleep Foundation recommends 8-10 hours for teens compared to 7-9 for adults.

### Medicine

**Myth**: Vaccines can cause autism or other diseases.

**Fact**: Science couldn't be clearer on this: vaccines are safe, effective, and do NOT cause diseases like autism. In fact, they protect you from many serious and potentially deadly diseases, from measles to HPV.

### Technology

**Myth**: Teens are addicted to technology and it's ruining their brains.

**Fact**: Research shows that moderate use of technology can be beneficial. It can aid in learning, foster creativity and even improve multitasking. The key is balance. 

```
smart_tech_usage = {
    "learn_new_skills": True,
    "connect_with_friends": True,
    "create_content": True,
    "mindlessly_scroll": False 
}
```
Remember, the next time someone tells you that staying up late is bad, vaccines are harmful, or screen time is rotting your brain, you have the scientific facts on your side. Your teenage superpowers are unique and they should be celebrated, not criticized. 

Keep exploring, keep pushing boundaries, and continue to use your powers for the greater good!
