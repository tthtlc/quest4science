    ```
    Sneak-peek: AI Algorithms
    
    if (task == mundane) {
      AI.perform(task);
    } else {
      human.perform(task);
    }
    ```

2. **Blockchain Technology** - Think of it as a super secure, digital ledger. Bitcoin, FTW! But it's not only about cryptocurrencies anymore. Blockchain has the potential to revolutionize how we handle contracts, agreements, and trust in the digital world. It's all about transparency and security.

3. **3D Printing** - Imagine sketching a masterpiece on your tablet and then just printing it out in 3D. No, this is not a Sci-Fi movie, it's real and happening! From toys to food (Yes! Food), 3D printers are a huge game-changer.

4. **Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)** - Don't just play the game, be IN the game. That's right, with VR and AR, you're no longer a spectator but a part of the show. And it's not just for entertainment, it's being used in education, healthcare, and even real estate!

5. **Internet of Things (IoT)** - Your phone can control your home's heating system or even your toaster. IoT is making all our devices 'smart'.
