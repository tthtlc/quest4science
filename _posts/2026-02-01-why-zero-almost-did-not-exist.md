## The invention of nothing

*By Peter Teoh, Science Writer*

Zero feels obvious today, but it took centuries to accept. The idea of representing nothing as a number challenged philosophy, religion, and mathematics.

### **Explainer: From placeholder to number**
**Focus:**
Early civilizations used blank spaces as placeholders, but a true zero needed a symbol and rules for arithmetic. Indian mathematicians formalized it, and the concept spread through trade and scholarship.

Once zero was accepted, place-value notation and algebra became far more powerful. It is a quiet invention that reshaped science, finance, and computation.

### Summary of Key Ideas:
- Zero began as a placeholder, not a number.
