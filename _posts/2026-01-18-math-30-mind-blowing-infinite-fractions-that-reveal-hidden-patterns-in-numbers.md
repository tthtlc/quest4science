## The secret language of infinite fractions

*By Peter Teoh, Science Writer*

Continued fractions are a fascinating and powerful way to represent real numbers—especially irrational ones—with remarkable precision using integers. Below is a list of **30 different popular or mathematically significant continued fractions**, including well-known constants, algebraic numbers, and special functions. Each entry includes the number (or expression) and its simple (regular) continued fraction representation, often in compact notation.

### Notes on Continued Fractions

**Simple continued fractions** use only positive integers after the first term and have the form:

a₀ + 1/(a₁ + 1/(a₂ + 1/(a₃ + ⋯)))

denoted compactly as [a₀; a₁, a₂, a₃, …].

**Key insights:**

- Quadratic irrationals (like √n for non-square n) always have **periodic** continued fractions (Lagrange's theorem).
- Transcendental numbers (e, π, etc.) have **non-periodic** expansions, though some (like *e*) show regular patterns.
- Some entries (e.g., ζ(3), γ) are not proven to be irrational via continued fractions alone, but their CFs are computed numerically.

### Side Notes

- *The Golden Ratio* φ = (1 + √5)/2 has the simplest possible continued fraction—all 1s—making it the "most irrational" number.
- *Euler's number e* has a beautiful pattern: [2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, …] where the pattern 1, 2k, 1 repeats.
- *Pi* remains mysterious—despite centuries of study, no pattern has been found in its continued fraction.
- The *Feigenbaum constant* δ appears in chaos theory and describes the rate at which bifurcations occur.

### Trending Sidebar

- **Golden Ratio Everywhere:** From DNA helices to galaxy arms, φ appears throughout nature.
- **Why 292?** The surprisingly large term in π's continued fraction makes it exceptionally well-approximated by 355/113.
- **Chaos and Constants:** How Feigenbaum's δ connects continued fractions to chaos theory.
- **Best Rational Approximations:** Continued fractions give the optimal way to approximate any irrational number.
