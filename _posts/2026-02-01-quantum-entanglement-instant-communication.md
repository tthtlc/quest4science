## Spooky links that still obey physics

*By Peter Teoh, Science Writer*

Entangled particles share correlated states, no matter how far apart they are. The correlations are real, but they cannot send messages faster than light.

### **Explainer: What entanglement actually does**
**Focus:**
When two particles are entangled, measuring one instantly fixes the outcome of the other. The key is that the outcome is random, so no controllable signal is sent.

Experiments have closed many loopholes and confirmed that classical hidden-variable explanations fail. Entanglement now powers quantum computing and ultra-secure communication protocols.

### Summary of Key Ideas:
- Entanglement creates strong correlations, not instant messaging.
- Measurements are random, so no faster-than-light signal.
- The effect is central to quantum technologies.

---

### Side Notes
- Bell tests show nature violates classical expectations.
- Quantum teleportation moves states, not matter.

---

### Trending Sidebar
- Quantum networks and repeaters.
- Entanglement in quantum sensors.
