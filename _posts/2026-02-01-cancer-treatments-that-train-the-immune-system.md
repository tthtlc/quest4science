## Turning the immune system into a therapy

*By Peter Teoh, Science Writer*

Immunotherapy helps the body recognize and attack cancer cells. Instead of poisoning tumors, it boosts natural defenses.

### **Explainer: How immunotherapy works**
**Focus:**
Checkpoint inhibitors release the brakes on T cells, letting them attack tumors more aggressively. CAR-T therapy engineers a patient's T cells to target specific cancer markers.

These treatments can be powerful, but they also carry risks like immune overreaction. Matching the right therapy to the right tumor is an ongoing challenge.

---

### Summary of Key Ideas:
- Checkpoint inhibitors restore immune activity.
- CAR-T reprograms T cells to target tumors.
- Side effects come from immune activation.

---

### Side Notes
- Not all cancers respond to immunotherapy.
- Combination therapies are common in trials.

---

### Trending Sidebar
- Personalized cancer vaccines.
- Biomarkers to predict response.
