*Side Effects of Checkpoint Inhibitors: What Patients Should Know*

Checkpoint inhibitors can cause typical "chemo-like" side effects (fatigue, nausea) but their hallmark is **immune-related** inflammation, where activated T cells attack normal organs. These effects can appear weeks to months after starting treatment and sometimes even after stopping.

### Very common, often mild effects
Across melanoma, lung, kidney, bladder and other responsive cancers, common non-serious symptoms include:
- Fatigue and low energy. [cancer](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/managing-cancer/treatment-types/immunotherapy/immune-checkpoint-inhibitors.html)
- Mild skin problems: rash, itching, dry skin, vitiligo-like light patches. [cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/immune-checkpoint-inhibitors-melanoma-long-term-side-effects)
- Gastrointestinal upset: mild diarrhea, nausea, decreased appetite, abdominal discomfort. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6900917/)
- Mild joint and muscle aches. [cancerresearch](https://www.cancerresearch.org/immunotherapy-side-effects)

### Immune-related organ inflammation (can be serious)
Any organ can be inflamed; typical patterns are similar across the advanced cancers where these drugs are used:

- Skin: more intense rash, blistering, or extensive itching; rarely severe skin reactions needing urgent care. [cancercouncil.com](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/cancer-treatment/immunotherapy/side-effects-of-immunotherapy/)
- Gut (colitis): persistent or bloody diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain, fever; in severe cases risk of bowel perforation. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6900917/)
- Liver (hepatitis): usually picked up as raised liver enzymes on blood tests, sometimes with jaundice, dark urine, or right-upper-quadrant pain. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10247998/)
- Lungs (pneumonitis): dry cough, shortness of breath, chest discomfort; can be life-threatening if not recognized early. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.21.01440)
- Endocrine glands:
  - Thyroiditis: hyper- then often hypothyroidism (fatigue, weight change, feeling cold, constipation, hair loss).
  - Pituitary or adrenal inflammation (hypophysitis, adrenalitis): headaches, low blood pressure, severe fatigue, nausea, electrolyte changes; often requires long-term hormone replacement. [cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/immune-checkpoint-inhibitors-melanoma-long-term-side-effects)
- Joints and muscles: inflammatory arthritis or myositis with significant pain, stiffness, or weakness that can persist long term. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10247998/)
- Kidneys: immune-mediated nephritis causing rising creatinine and reduced kidney function, sometimes with swelling or decreased urine output. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.21.01440)
- Nervous system and heart (rare but dangerous): myocarditis (chest pain, heart failure, arrhythmias), neuropathies or Guillain-Barre-like syndromes, meningitis or encephalitis. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6900917/)

### Infusion-related and systemic reactions
During or shortly after infusions, patients may experience:
- Infusion reactions resembling allergy: fever, chills, flushing, rash, wheeze, shortness of breath, low blood pressure. [cancer](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/managing-cancer/treatment-types/immunotherapy/immune-checkpoint-inhibitors.html)
- Rare cytokine-release-like syndromes with high fever, low blood pressure, fast heart rate, and severe malaise. [cancer](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/managing-cancer/treatment-types/immunotherapy/immune-checkpoint-inhibitors.html)

### Frequency and severity patterns
- Most patients either have no side effects or only mild ones; serious (grade 3-4) immune-related events occur in a minority but are more common with combination regimens (e.g., PD-1 + CTLA-4) than with single agents. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10247998/)
- Some toxicities, especially endocrine and joint problems, can become chronic and persist for years after treatment, even when the cancer is controlled. [cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/immune-checkpoint-inhibitors-melanoma-long-term-side-effects)

### Management principles in advanced cancers
- Mild effects are often managed with symptomatic treatment while continuing immunotherapy and close monitoring. [cancerresearchuk](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/treatment-and-other-post-diagnosis-issues/immunotherapy-and-its-side-effects)
- Moderate to severe organ inflammation usually requires holding the drug and starting corticosteroids; life-threatening cases may need high-dose steroids, additional immunosuppressants, and permanent discontinuation.
