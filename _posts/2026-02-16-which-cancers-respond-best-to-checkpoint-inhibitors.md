*Which Cancers Respond Best to Checkpoint Inhibitors?*

The strongest and most consistent responses to checkpoint inhibitors are seen in a handful of **highly immunogenic** advanced cancers, plus any advanced solid tumor with certain DNA-repair defects. Responses vary a lot by cancer type and by individual. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12071127/)

## Cancers with best-established benefit

These are the advanced/metastatic cancers where checkpoint inhibitors have become core, often first-line, treatment because of relatively high response rates and durable control:

- Melanoma and some other advanced skin cancers (e.g., Merkel cell carcinoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma) show some of the most durable responses and long-term survivals with PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 blockade, especially with combinations. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9139602/)
- Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has robust benefit, particularly when PD-L1 expression is high, with response rates around 40-50% for some PD-1/PD-L1 regimens. [sciencedirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0007455120303532)
- Kidney (renal cell) cancer responds well, and ICI-based combinations (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors alone or with CTLA-4 or targeted VEGF/tyrosine-kinase inhibitors) are standard for metastatic disease. [ascopubs](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/EDBK_323835)
- Bladder (urothelial) cancer shows meaningful responses and survival gains in advanced stages, and checkpoint inhibitors are widely used after or instead of chemotherapy. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4910761/)
- Hodgkin lymphoma has very high response rates to PD-1 blockade because of strong PD-L1/PD-L2 expression driven by genetic changes. [cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/checkpoint-inhibitors)

## Other solid tumors with clear, but more selective, benefit

Several other advanced cancers benefit from checkpoint inhibitors, but often only in subsets or in combination with chemotherapy/targeted therapy:

- Liver (hepatocellular) cancer: atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and other ICI-based regimens improve progression-free and overall survival vs older systemic therapies. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12071127/)
- Triple-negative breast cancer: benefit mainly in PD-L1-positive disease, especially when pembrolizumab is combined with chemotherapy. [cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/checkpoint-inhibitors)
- Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: PD-1 inhibitors improve survival in recurrent/metastatic disease versus standard chemotherapy. [mdanderson](https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/what-cancers-can-be-treated-with-immunotherapy.h00-159695178.html)
- Esophageal and gastric cancers: PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, often with chemotherapy, improve outcomes in PD-L1-expressing advanced disease. [mdanderson](https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/what-cancers-can-be-treated-with-immunotherapy.h00-159695178.html)
- Some gynecologic cancers (e.g., endometrial) and others like small-cell lung cancer also have approved ICI indications, usually in biomarker-defined or treatment-line-specific settings.

## DNA-repair-deficient and MSI-H tumors (any primary site)

A special group that tends to respond unusually well are advanced solid tumors that are:

- Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch-repair deficient (dMMR)
- Have very high tumor mutational burden

These tumors produce many abnormal proteins (neoantigens), making them highly visible to the immune system once checkpoints are blocked. PD-1 inhibitors are approved in a "tumor-agnostic" way here, meaning any advanced solid tumor with MSI-H/dMMR status can be treated regardless of where it started (colon, endometrium, stomach, etc.). [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12071127/)

## Tumors that generally respond poorly

Some common advanced cancers, such as microsatellite-stable (MSS) colorectal cancer and many pancreatic cancers, usually have low response rates to checkpoint inhibitors unless special features (like MSI-H, high mutational burden, or specific combinations in trials) are present. In these, ICIs are mainly used in biomarker-defined subgroups or clinical trials rather than as routine therapy.
