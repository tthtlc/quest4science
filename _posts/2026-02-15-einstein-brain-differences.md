## Exploring the strange world of quadratic irrationals

*By Peter Teoh, Science Writer*

Quadratic irrationals are irrational numbers that are roots of quadratic equations with integer coefficients. They often appear in number theory, continued fractions, and Diophantine approximation. Below are several **example problems** involving quadratic irrationals, ranging from basic to more advanced.

Research on Albert Einstein’s brain has been going on since it was removed in 1955 by pathologist Thomas Harvey. Scientists compared it with brains of typical adults and sometimes with other high-IQ individuals.

Below are the **major scientifically documented differences**, explained from anatomical → cellular → functional levels.

---

# 1. Unusual parietal lobe structure (MOST famous finding)

## What researchers found

In 1999, neuroscientist Sandra Witelson discovered:

👉 Einstein’s **inferior parietal lobule (IPL)** was:

* ~15% wider than average
* Had **missing parietal operculum**
* Showed unusual cortical folding

---

## Why this matters (low-level function)

The IPL is responsible for:

* Mathematical reasoning
* Spatial visualization
* Abstract symbolic processing
* Mental rotation

These functions rely heavily on:

### Neural circuits involved

```
Visual cortex → dorsal stream → parietal cortex
                              ↓
                   numerical cognition networks
```

The IPL integrates:

* Visual spatial data
* Working memory
* Symbolic abstraction

---

## How Einstein differed from other geniuses

Compared with other high-IQ brains studied:

| Feature            | Einstein           | Other geniuses     |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| IPL size           | Very enlarged      | Usually normal     |
| Parietal operculum | Missing            | Present            |
| Symmetry           | Highly symmetrical | Often asymmetrical |

This suggests his brain had **exceptional cross-hemisphere integration**.

---

# 2. Higher density of glial cells

A 1985 study by Marian Diamond found:

👉 Einstein had **more glial cells per neuron** in association cortex.

---

## What glial cells actually do (low-level)

Glia are NOT just “support cells”.

They:

* Regulate synaptic signaling
* Supply metabolic fuel (lactate shuttle)
* Control neurotransmitter recycling
* Modulate learning plasticity

Example:

```
Neuron fires → glutamate released
Astrocytes absorb glutamate → convert → return precursors
```

Higher glia density =

✔ faster signal stabilization
✔ better metabolic efficiency
✔ stronger long-term potentiation (LTP)

---

## Difference vs other geniuses

Many genius brains show:

* Larger neurons
* Thicker cortex

Einstein uniquely showed:

* **More glial support per neuron**

This suggests his advantage may have been **processing efficiency**, not just raw neuron count.

---

# 3. Corpus callosum was unusually thick

The corpus callosum connects the left and right hemispheres.

MRI studies (2009 reanalysis) showed:

👉 Einstein’s callosal fibers were **denser and thicker**.

---

## Functional implications

This improves:

* Interhemispheric communication
* Integration of logic + imagery
* Faster signal transfer

For physics thinking, this is crucial:

```
Left brain → symbolic math
Right brain → spatial visualization
Corpus callosum → integration
```

Other geniuses typically show:

* Strong lateralization
* One hemisphere dominance

Einstein showed **strong integration instead**.

---

# 4. Unusual cortical folding (gyrification)

His brain had:

* More complex folding patterns
* Extra convolutions in frontal & parietal regions

---

## Why folding matters

More folds = more cortical surface area.

This increases:

* Neuron packing density
* Computational capacity

Think of it like:

```
Flat cortex → limited wiring
Highly folded cortex → massive parallel wiring
```

Einstein’s folding pattern was especially complex in:

* Prefrontal cortex
* Mathematical reasoning regions

---

# 5. Smaller overall brain size (SURPRISING FACT)

Einstein’s brain:

* ~1230 grams
* Slightly **below average male brain weight**

This contradicts early myths that genius = larger brain.

---

## What this tells neuroscientists

Modern understanding:

👉 Intelligence depends more on:

* Connectivity efficiency
* Synaptic plasticity
* Network architecture

NOT sheer size.

---

# 6. Differences compared to other famous genius brains

Here’s a high-level comparison:

| Feature            | Einstein          | Other famous brains (e.g., mathematicians, writers) |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Brain size         | Slightly smaller  | Often average                                       |
| Parietal lobe      | Highly enlarged   | Usually normal                                      |
| Glial density      | Much higher       | Slightly elevated                                   |
| Corpus callosum    | Very thick        | Normal                                              |
| Hemisphere balance | Highly integrated | Often asymmetric                                    |

---

# 7. Important scientific caution

Modern neuroscience emphasizes:

⚠️ No single “genius brain pattern” exists.

Studies show:

* High intelligence arises from **network efficiency**
* Environment + training reshape neural circuits
* Brain plasticity plays a huge role

Einstein’s differences likely reflect:

* Genetic predisposition
* Intense lifelong cognitive training
* Unique thinking style (visual imagination)

---

# 8. Most likely explanation (modern neuroscience view)

Today’s consensus:

Einstein’s brain was optimized for:

```
High connectivity
+ efficient metabolic support
+ strong cross-hemisphere integration
= exceptional abstract reasoning ability
```

Not simply “bigger” or “more neurons”.
