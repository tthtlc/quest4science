## Visualizing a world beyond 3D

*By Peter Teoh, Science Writer*

We cannot see four spatial dimensions, but we can still reason about them. Mathematicians use projections and slices to show how 4D objects behave when they pass through 3D space.

### **Explainer: From tesseracts to shadows**
**Focus:**
A tesseract is the 4D version of a cube. Just as a cube casts a square shadow, a tesseract can cast a 3D shadow that looks like a cube inside a cube with connecting edges. The projection distorts lengths, but it preserves the relationships between edges and faces.

Another tool is slicing. If a 4D object moved through 3D space, we would see a sequence of 3D cross-sections that grow, change, and shrink. This is the same way a CT scan rebuilds a 3D model from 2D slices.

### Summary of Key Ideas:
- 4D objects can be studied by projections into 3D.
- Cross-sections act like slices of a higher shape.
- The math extends 3D rules to more dimensions.

---

### Side Notes
- Hypercubes have 16 vertices and 32 edges.
- Distance formulas extend cleanly to any dimension.

---

### Trending Sidebar
- 4D geometry in data visualization.
- Higher-dimensional puzzles and games.
