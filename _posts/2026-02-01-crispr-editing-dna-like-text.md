## A molecular tool for precise edits

*By Peter Teoh, Science Writer*

CRISPR is a gene-editing system adapted from bacterial defenses. It lets scientists target and cut DNA with remarkable accuracy.

### **Explainer: How the CRISPR toolkit works**
**Focus:**
A guide RNA matches a DNA sequence, and the Cas enzyme cuts at that exact location. The cell then repairs the cut, allowing researchers to disable a gene or insert new DNA.

The technique is powerful but not perfect. Off-target edits and ethical concerns mean strict controls and careful study are needed.

---

### Summary of Key Ideas:
- Guide RNA directs a Cas enzyme to a target.
- Cells repair cuts, enabling edits.
- Precision and ethics are central challenges.

---

### Side Notes
- CRISPR has variants for base editing and gene regulation.
- Delivery into cells is often the hardest step.

---

### Trending Sidebar
- CRISPR therapies in clinical trials.
- Gene drives for disease control.
