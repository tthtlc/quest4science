## Slowing the cellular clock

*By Peter Teoh, Science Writer*

Aging is driven by many processes: DNA damage, cellular senescence, and declining repair systems. Scientists are testing ways to slow or reverse these effects.

### **Explainer: Targets for longevity**
**Focus:**
Telomeres shorten as cells divide, and senescent cells stop dividing but keep releasing harmful signals. Some therapies aim to remove senescent cells or boost repair pathways.

Early results in animals are promising, but translating to safe human treatments is complex. Aging is not one switch, it is a network of interacting systems.

---

### Summary of Key Ideas:
- Aging involves damage, senescence, and reduced repair.
- Senolytics target harmful senescent cells.
- Human applications are still experimental.

---

### Side Notes
- Lifestyle factors remain the most proven interventions.
- Biomarkers of aging are an active research area.

---

### Trending Sidebar
- Senolytic drug trials.
- Epigenetic clocks for aging.
