*The periodic table predicts how elements behave.*

## Patterns that predict behavior

*By Peter Teoh, Science Writer*

The periodic table organizes elements by atomic number and repeating properties. Its structure lets chemists predict reactions and materials.

### **Explainer: Why the table is periodic**
**Focus:**
As you add protons, electrons fill shells in a predictable order. Elements in the same column share valence electrons, which drive chemical behavior.

That is why sodium and potassium react similarly, or why noble gases are stable. The table is a map of electron structure, not just a list.

---

### Summary of Key Ideas:
- Atomic number sets electron configuration.
- Columns group elements with similar chemistry.
- Trends like electronegativity follow table patterns.

---

### Side Notes
- The table predicted elements before they were discovered.
- New superheavy elements test the table's limits.

---

### Trending Sidebar
- Periodic trends in material design.
- Superheavy element research.
