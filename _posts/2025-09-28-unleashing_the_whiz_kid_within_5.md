# Unleashing the Whiz Kid Within: 5 Incredible Science Experiments Teens Can Try!

Hey there, young Einsteins! Always thought science was all about long equations and boring text books? Well, think again! Today we're rolling up our sleeves and digging into some hands-on experiments that are not only fun, but will also make you fall in love with science. Let's start unleashing that whiz kid within!

## 1. Homemade Lava Lamp
You will need an empty container, vegetable oil, water, food coloring, and Alka-Seltzer tablets. Fill the container about 3/4 full with oil. Add water until the container is nearly full. Add about 10 drops of food coloring, then break the Alka-Seltzer into several pieces and drop them in one at a time. Watch your homemade lava lamp light up!

## 2. Making Invisible Ink
Channel your inner secret agent by creating invisible ink with lemon juice. Write a message with a cotton swab dipped in lemon juice, let it dry, then heat the paper carefully to reveal the secret message!

## 3. DIY Slime
Kids love slime! You'll need glue, borax, and water. Mix equal parts of glue and water, then slowly add borax until you get the desired consistency. Add food coloring to make it more fun!

```python
def make_slime(glue, water, borax):
    slime = glue + water
    while slime != desired_consistency:
        slime += borax
```

## 4. Crystal Growing
Prepare a solution with 3 parts hot water and 1 part borax. Pour the solution into a jar, then hang a pipe cleaner shape so that it's immersed in the solution but not touching the sides. Leave it overnight, and voila, you'll have grown your own crystals!

## 5. Egg in a Bottle
With adult supervision, heat a hard-boiled egg in a pan then put it on top of a bottle opening. As the egg cools, it will get sucked into the bottle due to the change in air pressure!

Remember, the best scientists always take safety precautions. So, don your lab glasses, flex your whiz kid muscles, and get experimenting! Stay curious, stay adventurous and most importantly, have fun!
