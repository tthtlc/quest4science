Sleep is not wasted time. It is when the brain consolidates memories, clears waste, and resets key systems.


### **Explainer: What happens while you sleep**
**Focus:**
During deep sleep, the glymphatic system flushes metabolic waste from the brain. REM sleep supports learning and emotional processing by reinforcing neural connections.

Lack of sleep affects attention, immunity, and long-term health. Consistent sleep patterns are one of the simplest ways to improve cognitive performance.

### Summary of Key Ideas:
- Sleep clears brain waste and supports learning.
- REM and deep sleep have distinct roles.
- Chronic sleep loss harms health.

---

### Side Notes
- Caffeine blocks adenosine, delaying sleepiness.
- Circadian rhythms are tuned by light exposure.

---

### Trending Sidebar
- Sleep tracking and wearable tech.
- Links between sleep and dementia risk.
