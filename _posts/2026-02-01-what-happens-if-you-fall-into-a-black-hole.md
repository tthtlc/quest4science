## A one-way trip through warped spacetime

*By Peter Teoh, Science Writer*

A black hole is a region where gravity is so strong that not even light escapes. The closer you get, the more time and space stretch.

### **Explainer: From horizon to spaghettification**
**Focus:**
Crossing the event horizon is not a dramatic moment for a large black hole, but it is the point of no return. Tidal forces grow with proximity, stretching objects into long strands in a process called spaghettification.

For stellar-mass black holes, the tides are lethal before the horizon. For supermassive ones, you might cross first and be destroyed later, deep inside where physics is still uncertain.

---

### Summary of Key Ideas:
- The event horizon is the boundary of no return.
- Tidal forces stretch and tear matter apart.
- Supermassive black holes are gentler at the horizon.

---

### Side Notes
- Time appears to slow for distant observers.
- Inside the horizon, all paths lead inward.

---

### Trending Sidebar
- Black hole imaging and event horizon telescopes.
- Information paradox debates.
