*Your microbiome is a vast internal ecosystem.*

## Your hidden ecosystem

*By Peter Teoh, Science Writer*

Trillions of microbes live in and on the human body. They help digest food, train the immune system, and influence mood.

### **Explainer: Partners, not just passengers**
**Focus:**
Gut bacteria break down fibers we cannot digest and produce vitamins and signaling molecules. They also compete with pathogens and shape immune responses.

Disruptions to the microbiome can be linked to disease, but cause and effect are still being studied. Diet, antibiotics, and lifestyle all shift the microbial balance.

---

### Summary of Key Ideas:
- Microbes aid digestion and vitamin production.
- They help train the immune system.
- Balance matters for long-term health.

---

### Side Notes
- Microbial genes outnumber human genes by a wide margin.
- Fecal transplants can treat some infections.

---

### Trending Sidebar
- Personalized nutrition based on microbiome data.
- Microbiome links to mental health.
