*Warp drives bend spacetime instead of breaking light speed.*

## Faster than light without breaking the rules

*By Peter Teoh, Science Writer*

Warp drive ideas bend spacetime instead of moving a ship through it. The math is intriguing, but the physics is daunting.

---

### **Explainer: The Alcubierre concept**
**Focus:**
The Alcubierre metric proposes a bubble that contracts space in front and expands it behind, letting the bubble move effectively faster than light. The ship inside never locally exceeds the speed of light.

The catch is energy: the original solution requires exotic matter with negative energy density. Whether such matter can exist in usable amounts remains unknown.

---

### Summary of Key Ideas:
- Warp drive math uses spacetime geometry, not engine thrust.
- The ship does not locally exceed light speed.
- Exotic negative energy is the biggest hurdle.

---

### Side Notes
- Quantum effects can create tiny negative energy regions.
- Stability and causality issues are unsolved.

---

### Trending Sidebar
- Advanced propulsion concepts.
- Casimir effect and negative energy.
