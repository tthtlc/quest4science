*Who Is Most at Risk for Checkpoint Inhibitor Side Effects?*

Several clinical and patient-related features are linked to a higher risk of immune-related side effects from checkpoint inhibitors, but none are perfectly predictive. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6900917/)

## Treatment-related risk factors

- Drug class and combination
  - CTLA-4 inhibitors (e.g., ipilimumab) generally cause more and more severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs) than PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10247998/)
  - Combination therapy (e.g., ipilimumab + nivolumab) has the highest rates of grade 3-4 irAEs, much higher than single-agent PD-1/PD-L1. [jitc.bmj](https://jitc.bmj.com/content/12/7/e008591)

- Dose and schedule
  - Higher doses of CTLA-4 inhibitors are associated with more frequent and severe toxicities. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6900917/)
  - Prolonged exposure (many cycles) increases the opportunity for late-onset and chronic irAEs to emerge. [cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/immune-checkpoint-inhibitors-melanoma-long-term-side-effects)

## Patient-related risk factors

- Pre-existing autoimmune disease
  - Patients with conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, or lupus have higher rates of autoimmune flares and new irAEs, though many can still be treated carefully. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8505368/)

- Prior or current immunosuppression
  - Baseline steroids or other immunosuppressants may both mask and complicate emerging irAEs; some data suggest altered patterns of toxicity and infection risk. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8505368/)

- Older age and comorbidities
  - Older patients and those with significant heart, lung, liver, or kidney disease are more vulnerable if an irAE affects that same organ (e.g., pneumonitis in someone with severe COPD). [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10247998/)

- Cancer type and burden
  - Certain cancers (e.g., melanoma and lung cancer) show higher overall rates of irAEs, partly because they often receive combination or prolonged ICI therapy. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6900917/)
  - Higher tumor burden and strong early immune activation may correlate with both better responses and more toxicity in some studies. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10247998/)

## Biomarkers and lab features (emerging, not routine)

- Baseline inflammation markers
  - Elevated CRP, high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, or other systemic inflammation markers have been linked in some analyses to higher irAE risk, but this is not yet used routinely. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8505368/)

- Autoantibodies and HLA types
  - Pre-existing organ-specific autoantibodies and certain HLA genotypes have been associated with specific irAEs in small studies, suggesting an underlying autoimmune tendency. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10247998/)

- Late-onset risk factors
  - Longer survival and longer follow-up increase the chance of "late" irAEs (after 6-12 months or even post-treatment), and chronic endocrine or rheumatologic irAEs are more likely in patients who have already had an acute event.

## Practical implications

- The strongest, consistent risk factors in practice are: use of combination ICI, CTLA-4-containing regimens, pre-existing autoimmune disease, and significant comorbid organ dysfunction. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6900917/)
- Because prediction is imperfect, guidelines emphasize baseline assessment, patient education on early symptoms, and low threshold for workup and steroids when irAEs are suspected.
