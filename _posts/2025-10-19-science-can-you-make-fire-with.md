### Can You Make Fire with Ice? (Yes, Here’s How.)

*By Peter Teoh, Science Writer*

Imagine setting a block of ice on fire. Sounds impossible, right? After all, ice is frozen water, and fire needs fuel and heat to burn. But with a bit of chemistry magic, you actually *can* make fire with ice. Let's dive into how this fascinating reaction works and what makes it possible.

#### What is Fire, Anyway?
Fire is a chemical reaction called combustion. It happens when a fuel reacts quickly with oxygen, producing heat, light, and new substances like carbon dioxide and water vapor. Usually, fire needs something that can burn (like wood or gasoline) and enough heat to start the reaction.

Ice is just frozen water — so by itself, it can't burn. But what if ice is involved in a chemical reaction that *creates* a flammable gas?

---

#### The Secret Ingredient: Calcium Carbide
The key to making fire with ice is a chemical called **calcium carbide (CaC₂)**. When calcium carbide meets water, it reacts to produce **acetylene gas (C₂H₂)**, which is highly flammable:

\[
\text{CaC}_2 + 2 \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{Ca(OH)}_2 + \text{C}_2\text{H}_2 \uparrow
\]

Here's what happens:

- The water in the ice starts to melt just a little bit, creating liquid water on the surface.
- Calcium carbide reacts with this water, releasing acetylene gas.
- Acetylene is a colorless gas that burns very hot and bright.
- When you light the gas, it produces flames that seem to be burning *on* the ice!

This is not the ice burning — it’s the acetylene gas that ignites while the ice serves as the reaction medium.

#### How to Safely See Fire on Ice
**Important: This experiment should only be done with proper supervision and safety gear. Calcium carbide and acetylene are dangerous if handled improperly!**

Here’s a simple version of the setup:

1. Place chunks of ice in a glass or metal bowl.
2. Sprinkle a small amount of calcium carbide powder onto the ice.
3. Wait a few seconds for the reaction to start producing acetylene gas.
4. Carefully bring a lit match or lighter close to the bowl — the acetylene will ignite, creating visible flames on the ice.

You’ll see a bright, sometimes blue-tinged flame dancing above the icy surface, which looks like fire coming straight out of frozen water.

#### Why Doesn’t the Ice Just Melt Away?
The flame you see is fueled by the acetylene gas, which burns hotter than a candle flame. However, the ice remains cold because the melting water keeps feeding the reaction and cooling the system. The reaction produces calcium hydroxide (a solid) and acetylene gas, but the ice itself is not burning.

This creates a fascinating contrast — fire over ice — which seems almost magical but is really just chemistry in action.

#### Beyond the Fire and Ice Trick: Real-World Connections
This reaction is not just a cool science party trick. Acetylene is widely used in welding because it burns very hot. Also, the chemistry behind fire and ice reactions connects to natural phenomena like **methane clathrates** or "fire ice" — icy structures under the ocean floor that trap methane gas, which can burn if released.

Scientists even study nanoparticles that mimic these "fire ice" structures to explore new materials and energy solutions.

---

#### Summary
Yes, you *can* make fire with ice — but only by combining ice with calcium carbide to produce flammable acetylene gas. This fiery reaction is a vivid example of how chemistry can surprise us, turning something as cold and simple as ice into a source of fire.

Just remember: don’t try this at home without expert supervision!

### Side Notes
- **Calcium Carbide** was once used in carbide lamps before electric lights were common.
- **Acetylene Gas** burns very hot, up to about 3300 °C (6000 °F) in oxygen.
- The reaction produces **calcium hydroxide**, a harmless powdery substance often called slaked lime.

### Trending Sidebar: Other Cool Science Fire Tricks
- **Cold Fire:** Scientists can create flames that feel cold to the touch using special gases like helium.
- **Methane Clathrates:** Also called "fire ice," these natural gas hydrates can burn while still frozen.
- **Plasma Flames:** Using plasma torches, fire can be made at extreme temperatures for cutting metals.
