## Powers meet real-world forces

*By Peter Teoh, Science Writer*

Superhero feats are fun, but physics exposes the hidden costs. Speed, strength, and flight all demand huge energy and structural support.

---

### **Explainer: Why powers would be dangerous**
**Focus:**
A super-speed sprint would heat the air and shred normal materials, while a massive jump would crush the ground underfoot. Flight requires either constant thrust or exotic control of gravity.

Even super strength has limits, because bones, joints, and the ground must handle the forces. Physics does not kill the fun, it shows the scale of what would be required.

---

### Summary of Key Ideas:
- High speed creates extreme heat and drag forces.
- Strength is limited by material stress and ground support.
- Flight needs enormous energy or new physics.

---

### Side Notes
- Comic writers sometimes hand-wave with force fields.
- Real-world materials set hard limits on feats.

---

### Trending Sidebar
- Physics in movies and visual effects.
- Engineering limits of human performance.
