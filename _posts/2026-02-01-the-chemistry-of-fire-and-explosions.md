## Rapid chemistry, rapid energy

*By Peter Teoh, Science Writer*

Fire is a fast oxidation reaction that releases heat and light. Explosions are the same chemistry, but faster and more confined.

### **Explainer: Fuel, oxygen, and heat**
**Focus:**
Combustion needs fuel, oxygen, and an ignition source. The reaction releases heat, which keeps the process going in a feedback loop.

Explosions occur when gases expand rapidly or when reactions release energy faster than it can dissipate. Confinement and particle size can make reactions drastically more violent.

---

### Summary of Key Ideas:
- Combustion is rapid oxidation with heat release.
- Explosions involve rapid expansion and pressure.
- Reaction rate controls intensity.

---

### Side Notes
- Dust explosions can happen in grain silos.
- Flame color depends on excited atoms and ions.

---

### Trending Sidebar
- Safer fuels and combustion modeling.
- Fire dynamics research.
